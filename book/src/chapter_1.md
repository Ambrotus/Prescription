# The Condo Entrance

This is the first area I have started working on for the game. 
Currently it is modeled after my surroundings!

The sliding doors pictured above were my first look into the blueprint system. Before this system I was used to the trigger system used by older versions of Unreal. So I looked at it the same way. 

We need a trigger volume and some animations for the door!

Here I also learned about sockets!

An elevator triggered by linetracing with blueprints. Youtube video will be created soon.
Blueprint also posted in a more userfriendly spot. https://blueprintue.com/blueprint/j2zr1hyq/
