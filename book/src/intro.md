# The Set Up


The main character accidently has their glasses broken in the night by their partner. So, the following morning they try to book an appointment with their optometrist to get a new set of glasses and updated prescription. However, they were fully booked up and the main character needs to wait. This sets up the blurry vision mechanic as they will carry whatâ€™s left of their glasses as they adventure around their home.
This was based off an idea of what I see when I take my dog out at night and forget my glasses, just as someone more near sighted.

I am thinking of having a system similar to Outlast but instead of a night vision camera, we can use a left over lens from the glasses for more clear vision.


That said, I am still playing with the focal distances to find a good medium as I dont want to have the player strain their eyes but also dont want them to permanently hold the clear vision key.

If player damage is added into this game, I'm thinking on using the remaining lens as a sort of health bar.
Any damage you take, the lens cracks. As soon as it shatters, Game over.
