The sliding doors shown above were my first look into the blueprint system. Before this system I was used to the trigger system used by older versions of Unreal. So I looked at it the same way. 

We'll need a trigger volume and some animations for the door!

With a trigger box and static meshes added to the blueprint, it is time to look at the events!
